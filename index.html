                    <p>Payment processing for debit and credit cards involves three steps: authorization, settlement, and funding. During authorization, the cardholder initiates the transaction, the merchant requests payment authorization from their chosen payment processor, and the card-issuing bank verifies and approves or declines the transaction.

                    <p>A savings account is an effective way to store your money in a secure location where it can earn interest.
